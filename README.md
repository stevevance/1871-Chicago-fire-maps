I am trying to create a GIS boundary of the "burnt district" showing where the Chicago fire of 1871 ravaged the city. This map will be loaded into the Chicago Cityscape [Maps Explorer](http://chicagocityscape.com/maps) database to be able to report to users if the address they searched for was located in the burnt district. 

## Maps

1. Studley map - unknown publication date

2. Gaylord Watson map - "Entered according to an Act of Congress in the year 1871 by Gaylord Watson in the Office of the Librarian of Congress in Washington". I don't know if Watson drew the map.
