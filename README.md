I am trying to create a GIS boundary of the "burnt district" showing where the Chicago fire of 1871 ravaged the city. This map will be loaded into the Chicago Cityscape [Maps Explorer](http://chicagocityscape.com/maps) database to be able to report to users if the address they searched for was located in the burnt district. 

## Maps

- Studley map - unknown publication date, drawn by the R.P. Studley Company, St. Louis, "3rd edition".
- Gaylord Watson map - "Entered according to an Act of Congress in the year 1871 by Gaylord Watson in the Office of the Librarian of Congress in Washington". I don't know if Watson drew the map. 
- [Conzen map](https://www.greatchicagofire.org/item/nuamps026_ech_map29a/) - 2004, drawn by Michael P. Conzen with research assistance from Christopher P. Thale, and cartographic design by Dennis McClendon
